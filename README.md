The labs below were done in Computer Engineering courses at McMaster University.

##### Lab 1 & 2:  Operations with Huge Integers:
        - integer with range between -2^63 to 2^63 -1
        - huge integer's addition, subtraction, multiplication and comparison
        - average and worst running time analysis

##### Lab 3:  Implementation of Polynomial Using Linked List
        - sorted singly linked list with a dummy header
        - addition and Multiplication of Polynomials
        - average and worst running time analysis
        - memory requirement analysis

        - BST construction
        - return in-order, post-order and pre-order traverse (recursive)
        - search element in BST
        - determine union, intersection and difference sets between two BSTs
        
##### Lab 5:  Hash Tables with Linear and Quadratic Probing
        - resolve collision by linear and quadratic probing
        - rehash
