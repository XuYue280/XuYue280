The about labs were done in computer engineering courses at McMaster University.

##### Lab 6:  Functions and Arraysï¼š
        - add two vectors of the same size, with prototype  
        - returns the scalar product of two vectors of the same dimension  
        - return the norm of a vector
        - filter non-numeric characters from a string and return a string of zhiyopu numbers
        - sparse vector storage
        - sparse vector operations
        
##### Lab 7:  Strings, Dynamic Memory Allocation, C Structures   
        - allocate memory to store the combination of two strings
        - object-oriented programming
        
##### Lab 8:  C++ Classes
        - CUTE setup
        - matrix operation (copy, sub matrix, addition, upper triginal matrix, to string)

##### Lab 9:  Implementation of Sets Using Sorted Linked Lists
        - linked list construction
        - determine union, intersection and difference sets between two linked list
        - string to linked list
        - linked list to string
